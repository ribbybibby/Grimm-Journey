A Grimm Journey
===========

####Overview
Grimm Journey is a local co-op multiplayer platformer designed to be played by two people.

One player takes the role of the Big Bad Wolf while the other plays as Little Red Riding Hood. Together they must overcome different levels as they try to make their way to the beanstalk and climb it.

####Background
Grimm Journey started its life as a Ludum Dare 31 game jam entry. With fun game mechanics and an interesting art style the game placed in the top 16-36% of all entries ranking with the following score:

Out of 2,640 entries

400 Graphics(Jam) 3.48
406 Mood(Jam) 3.17
449 Audio(Jam) 2.85
746 Overall(Jam) 2.92
785 Innovation(Jam) 2.57
866 Fun(Jam) 2.52
890 Theme(Jam) 2.96

After the 72 hour game jam the team of four kept on working away at it.

It has since grown into something much bigger, better and more awesome.
